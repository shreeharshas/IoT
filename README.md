# Burglar Alarm System

This is an academic project conceptualizing an idea for an early warning system targeting burglary.

The computer program built and deployed to the Arduino board does the work of continuous monitoring of the 
fences or compuond walls to detect a potential intruder.

The system is designed to work differently during the day and night times intelligently and alert the residents.
Visual proof of the misdeed is also captured, giving concrete support to the victims.

This project is based on Arduino programming and designed forthe setup as depicted in the fritzing diagram.
